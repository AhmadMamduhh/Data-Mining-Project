# Data-Mining-Project
This is a project which implements classification on the wisconsin breast cancer dataset, regression on the diamonds dataset and clustering 
on the iris dataset. In classification: KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest are the algorithms used.
In regression: KNN regression, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Neural Network and Random Forest are the algorithms used. In clustering, K-Means is the algorithm used. The data is preprocessed prior to being used in any of the above algorithms.
